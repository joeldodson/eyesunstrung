# Music Theory - sort of

Calling what will likely be in this section theory is probably a stretch.
I can't say I really know what is and isn't considered "Music Theory."
I am curious though how western music evolved though.
And it is important to know about notes, keys, scales, and chords.
Mostly this area will be full of articles on music and guitar related themes I find interesting.

For a great, and quick, introduction to music theory,check out the YouTube video by Andrew Huang:
[learn music theory in half an hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0).

The very first article is me getting deep in the western music weeds with Claude (Anthropic's LLM)
It's nothing you need to know to play well.
It might help though when someone mentions, for example, "harmonics" and all you really need to know is 1, 3, 5.

Other articles might also be direct threads from Claude,
Or compilations of what I've learned from various sources, including LLMs.
Remember though, music is not my background, take what is here with some caution.
It's always a good idea to ask more questions, and explore on your own.
