# About 

I started Eyes Unstrung in July, 2024.
It was motivated by some articles and podcasts from
[RealPython](https://realpython.com).
Specifically, I initially started thinking bout it after skimming the article,
[Build a Guitar Synthesizer](https://realpython.com/python-guitar-synthesizer/).
Then I heard the [Creating a Guitar Synthesizer & Generating Wave Files podcast](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/210/),
and started getting excited about a possible project.

The immediately preceding podcast,
[Python's Command-Line Utilities & Music Information Retrieval Tools](https://realpython.com/podcasts/rpp/209/)
was full of very cool information regarding processing sound in Python.

After listening to the podcasts,
and thinking about the lack of accessible tools for blind and low vision people to learn and practice guitar,
I decided I'd try to build something we can all enjoy.

## About the license

Most projects I start on a whim are about tools for blind software developers.
If they become useful, and some big company wants to integrate them into their projects, great.
For that, I'm happy with an MIT Open Source license.

This project is slightly different.

I want blind people to have full access to the application and source code.
If however, this does become something,
I'd like to be more involved in how it might be used more broadly.
I wanted a license that would not be a fully open source project,
but I want individuals to feel free to use the app and play with the code.

The text of the license was generated by ChatGPT (of course it was) and hopefully is legitimate.
It seems to convey my intent at least.
And I don't think it violates the spirit of the open source projects on which this app is built. 
Feel free to send pedantic criticisms to  eyesunstrung@dev.null :wink:
