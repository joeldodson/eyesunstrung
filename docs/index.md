# Eyes Unstrung

That's a lyric from my favorite
[Grateful Dead](https://www.dead.net/)
song, [Ripple](https://www.dead.net/song/ripple).

## Indeed, a great song ... And?

Like many people, I've been trying to learn to play the guitar for many years.
Lot's of starts and, well, not so much stops, fading aways.

So much material for learning guitar, probably most musical instruments, is visual.
I have posters, from when I could see, with images of fingering for dozens of chords.
Then there's sheet music, which is inherently visual.
For guitar, there's tabulature, also visual.
Even on YouTube videos, I so often hear, "place your fingers like this..."
Some YouTubers do try to explain the fingering, but inevitably, there's a visual assumption. 

I'm sure there's some accessible material out there considering how many blind musicians there are.
It's either not easy to find, or I'm not very good at searching.
Probably both.

So, after hearing some podcasts on
[RealPython](https://realpython.com)
I decided I'd write an app for blind and low vision people wanting to learn to play guitar.

## Okay, nice, but what about unstrung?

In Spring, 2017, I lost my sight.
My optic nerves stroked out due to injuries from a car accident.
As I was thinking of names for this project,
I wanted a subtle reference to music and blindness.
The idea came to me of the optic nerve being the string from the eye to the brain.
And now my eyes are unstrung.

I don't want to put too much on this main page.
Check out the [about](about.md) page for a bit more background.
And, of course, there is a [blog](blog/index.md) where you can get more of my motivations and plans for the app.
