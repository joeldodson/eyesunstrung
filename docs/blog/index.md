# Blog

Ah, nice, another blog.

This one is different.
I'm writing it to help organize my thoughts.
And publishing it on github pages for my own easy access and tracking changes.
If others find the content interesting, great.
But really, it's all about my needs.

I'll probably go back and edit some articles.
In fact, I'm writing this introductory blurb mostly because I'm about to modify the first one.
I might add comments at the end of an article noting the changes.
Or maybe you can check the github repo if you're interested.

## [Something New](something_new.md)

Very brief thoughts on starting Eyes Unstrung.

## [Take Two](take_two.md)

13 months later, getting back to Eyes Unstrung.
